# ðŸš² Bike Sharing Demand Analysis  

Bike-sharing services provide convenient and eco-friendly transportation, allowing users to rent bikes from automated docks. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many providers have faced revenue declines. As the economy recovers, understanding the factors influencing bike demand is crucial for optimizing operations and improving profitability.  

This project aims to analyze historical data and build a predictive model to estimate bike demand based on various factors, including weather conditions, seasonal trends, and user behavior. By identifying key demand drivers, the model will help businesses make data-driven decisions, enhance service availability, and optimize resource allocation.  

### ðŸ“Œ Objectives:  
- Identify significant factors influencing bike demand  
- Develop a predictive model for demand estimation  
- Provide actionable insights for business strategy and operational efficiency  

### ðŸ“Š Dataset & Approach:  
The dataset includes daily bike usage statistics, meteorological data, and seasonal trends. A machine learning-based approach will be used to analyze relationships between independent variables (weather, time of year, etc.) and bike demand. The results will guide business decisions, helping providers align their services with market needs.  

This project serves as a valuable tool for understanding the demand dynamics of bike-sharing services, ensuring better customer satisfaction and profitability in a post-pandemic landscape
